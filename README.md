Based on the following React-Redux example, a TODO list application which allows the user to:
- Add a task
- Mark a task as completed or active
- Filter by task status 

Refactor the application to also allow the user to:
- Add a comment to any task in the list
- Edit a comment
- Show comments into a task
- Delete a task

Your goal is to add the features listed above and create a nice style for the application, but keep your focus on showing your skills with UX, CSS, Javascript and React. The app must be responsive, we will test it with mobile devices resolutions.
